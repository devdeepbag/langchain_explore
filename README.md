# LangChain Explore

This project demonstrates how to explore and use the LangChain library with OpenAI.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain_explore.git
cd langchain_explore
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

If you haven't already created a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 5. Running the Example

To run the example script and explore LangChain functionalities:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the example script to explore LangChain modules and functionalities.
- **`.env`**: Stores environment variables, including API keys.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the project dependencies.

## Dependencies

- `langchain-community`: Core LangChain functionalities.
- `langchain-openai`: Integration with OpenAI models.
- `openai`: Python client library for OpenAI.
- `python-dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Notes

- Ensure your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
- The LangChain library is actively evolving. Check the [LangChain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/) for updates and changes.
