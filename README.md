# LangChain Project

Welcome to the LangChain project! This README provides instructions for setting up your development environment and getting started with the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (for cloning the repository)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Project

You can now start exploring the project. For example, you can run a script to test the LangChain setup:

```bash
python examples/test_script.py
```

(Replace `examples/test_script.py` with the actual script you want to run.)

### 5. Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute to the project:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository by forking it on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes and test them.
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message"
   ```
5. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main repository.
